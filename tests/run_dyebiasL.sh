# Level-3 (E): dyeBiasL (linear dye bias). E is applied in its natural pipeline
# position -- AFTER channel inference (prep "CE"), where C and R agree on every
# Infinium-I channel, so the fR/fG median pools match and betas are bit-identical
# (up to float rounding). Applying E to the RAW SigDF instead would expose the
# handful of pre-C raw channel disagreements, which C resolves in the C step and
# which are unrelated to E. Compares full betas to R's
# getBetas(dyeBiasL(inferInfiniumIChannel(sdf))).

# Needs a store with the platform ordering, the R oracle, and IDATs; skips clean.

## R reads sesameData's manifest, C reads the store's InfiniumAnnotation
## ordering -- deliberately, because that IS the shipping configuration and the
## question is whether the annotation difference moves the biology. The two
## disagree on a few probes' design type (e.g. EPIC/HM450 cg07162498,
## cg09334382: Infinium-II in sesameData, Infinium-I in v8.1, which carries the
## corrected Illumina manifest). Those probes legitimately read differently, and
## they also sit in the Infinium-I median pools on one side only, nudging E's
## fG/fR for everything else.
##
## So this is NOT a bit-identity gate. It asserts the shape we actually care
## about: the overwhelming majority of probes agree to well within any
## biological resolution, and only a countable handful differ. A real E bug
## moves the whole distribution (an earlier channel-swap bug moved betas 0.4-0.7),
## which p99 catches immediately; an annotation difference moves a few probes.
