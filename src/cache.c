/* cache.c -- locating annotation in the shared store.
 *
 * sesame does not download anything. YAME owns fetching for the whole suite --
 * `yame fetch` writes the store, every tool that links libyame reads it -- so
 * this file is only path resolution plus the errors that name the command to
 * run. See YAME/src/assets.h.
 *
 * The store is keyed on the browser hierarchy -- species, then platform or
 * genome build -- which is the address a user navigates to, so a file one tool
 * downloads is found by the next:
 *
 *   <store>/MSA/SHA256SUMS         byte-identical copy of the remote
 *   <store>/MSA/MSA.ordering.tsv.gz
 *   <store>/MSA/MSA.hg38.mask.cm
 *   <store>/MSA/KYCG/...           kycg's per-platform sets
 *   <store>/hg38/seqinfo.tsv.gz    genome-level annotation
 *   <store>/hg38/KYCG/...          kycg's sequencing knowledgebase
 *
 * Note the store path is NOT the fetch address: `yame fetch` names a unit as
 * <source>/<target> (InfiniumAnnotation/MSA, genomes/hg38), because one
 * directory can be filled from more than one upstream -- <store>/hg38 holds
 * both the genomes files and, under KYCG/, the KYCGKB sets.
 *
 * Before this, sesame kept its own cache under ~/.cache/sesame and kycg kept one
 * under ~/.cache/kycg, and the two downloaded the identical InfiniumAnnotation
 * files separately.
 *
 * Mirroring means the store is self-describing and hand-verifiable per platform
 * (cd <store>/MSA && shasum -a 256 -c SHA256SUMS), with no
 * local bookkeeping -- and that stored SHA256SUMS is how a directory says which
 * upstream tag filled it. registry.h records the tag THIS build expects, which
 * is why the errors below quote it.
 *
 * Store location -- one rule, yame_assets_root():
 *
 *   $YAME_DATA_HOME, else ${XDG_DATA_HOME:-~/.local/share}/yame
 *
 * One variable for the whole suite, because a store only dedupes if every tool
 * agrees where it is. The data tier rather than a cache tier is deliberate:
 * these are multi-GB references that should survive somebody clearing ~/.cache.
 * An existing ~/.cache/sesame is detected and named in a one-line notice by
 * libyame, never read from and never moved.
 *
 * Resolution order (explicit always wins; same rule for library and CLI):
 *
 *   1. --index / --coords / --normals <path>          (caller-supplied)
 *   2. <store>/<platform>/<file>
 *   3. ./<file>
 *
 * sesame NEVER prompts and NEVER touches the network. If an asset is missing,
 * the caller gets an error naming the exact `yame fetch` to run. An interactive
 * prompt would hang forever in a Nextflow job or a Docker build -- silently, on
 * question one, across a whole run.
