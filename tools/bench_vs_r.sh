## Time the same job three ways: the C binary, R's openSesame measured inside a
## live session, and R measured as a user actually pays for it -- one shell
## invocation, R startup and library load included.
##
## The middle number is the honest algorithmic comparison; the third is the one
## that matters in a pipeline, where every sample is a fresh process. Reporting
## only one of them would be a half-truth in either direction.
